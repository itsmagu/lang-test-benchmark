A few examples made in a selection of languages to analyze their use and how fun they are to write in.
I am heavly biased towards Odin and C#. But I respect and consider the performance gain in Zig and Rust.
I have 6+ years experiance with C# and have pressed it for everything it got, I need something new.
I Love Odin but glare at the speed and comptime of Zig.
I enjoy Rust's shadowing, I do not enjoy the bloat.
I think Zig is promising and a great option, but I hate the error handling and random complexity.

Overall, I think C# is a great scripting langauge but I don't want to use unsafe anymore,
Odin should not feature freeze yet,
Rust should have feature freezed years ago,
Zig needs time...

## Depends
```
odin
zig
rust cargo
bflat
dotnet 8.0
hyperfine
```
## Configurations
```
cs_size is bflat optimized for size
cs_time is bflat optimized for speed
cs_publishAOT is dotnet 8.0 compiled to native
odin_size is odin optimized for size
odin_speed is odin optimized for speed
zig_speed is zig optimized for speed
zig_size is zig optimized for size
zig_safe is zig with safty checks
```
